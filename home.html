		</p>

		<br>

		<h2>about me</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Gavin Su and I'm 21 years old having recently completed my studies at the University of Auckland majoring in Computer Science. So having said that, this means I am now on the hunt for a graduate position in software development or in another related field of work.

		<h2>projects</h2>
		<p>
			You can find almost everything that involves code I've been working on in my own time by visiting my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/isgavinhere">isgavinhere</a>
			but below you can find some of the projects that have some significance to me (and maybe you) and you can find my Google Play applications <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=iodoiodon">here</a>.

			<br><br>
			<a href="https://github.com/isgavinhere/iodoiodon">iodoiodon</a> - This is a simple rock, paper, scissors (roshambo) bot I created that uses a markov chain to try to predict the players next move.
			<br><br>
			<a href="https://github.com/isgavinhere/lolAPIparser">lolAPIparser</a> - I made this to fool around with the API provided by Riot Games for their game League of Legends, it's a bit outdated now since they have updated their maps and queues so I will need to revisit this to add those in some time in the near future.
Good design is as little design as possible.
			<br><br>
			<a href="https:/github.com/isgavinhere/tinyFlatWhite">tinyFlatWhite</a> - This is a theme for Mozilla Firefox using the user style manager Stylish, it is modified from a theme created by someone else linked on my GitHub.

			<br><br>
			<a href="https://github.com/isgavinhere/wireBird">wireBird</a> - In my attempt to learn Android development I followed a tutorial to create a flappy bird clone while replacing the art and sounds with those created by me.

		<h2>about the site</h2>
		<p>
			The primary inspiration for the design of this website is my love of minimalism.
